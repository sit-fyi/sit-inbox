When sit-inbox signs off a patch, this is what
we can see:

```
Signed-off-by: sit-inbox <inbox@sit>
````

This e-mail address, being the default one, is not particularly
great.

Solution: expose repository.*.git_email and .git_username configuration
and include them in the schema.

Also, include them in the example config.
