New version of sit is switching to the flat records namespace
(.sit/records) which sit-inbox does not support.

Solution: make sure both the old and the new styles are supported

For the meantime this means that sit-inbox is tested against both latest
stable and "last known master" and the code has been adjusted to support
both layouts.
