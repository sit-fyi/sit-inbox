Problem: above patches don't actually send the e-mails

While tests pass, there was never even an attempt to
send an email.

Solution: specify MTA to `mailbot` explicitly

By default, `mailbot` invokes `sendmail -f` and msmtp
doesn't handle that well. Instead, `-t` should have been
passed so that `msmtp` will read recipients from the
message itself.
